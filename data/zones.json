    "description": "Planting Zones 12 and 13 are not found in the continental United States, but are located in both Hawaii and Puerto Rico. These two plant hardiness zones are extremely warm, tropical environments that are best suited for plants tolerant of intense heat. With the average minimum winter temperature between 50 and 70 degrees F, Zones 12 and 13, the warmest of all the USDA hardiness zones, feature tropical plants and exotic fruits.",
    "temperature": [
      "Zone 13 can expect minimum average temperatures of 60 to 70 degrees F",
      "Zone 13a has a minimum average temperature of 60 to 65 degrees F",
      "Zone 13b has a minimum average temperature of 65 to 70 degrees F",
      "The subzones in both Zones 12 and 13 can experience harsher temperatures depending on weather conditions."

    "planting": "Heat tolerance and maximum germination temperatures become an issue in Zones 12 and 13. Tropical plants are the key to gardening and landscaping in the extreme heat of both these zones. Growers germinate indoors, purchase plants from nurseries and grow many vegetables during the cooler winter months.",
